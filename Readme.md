# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

A simple Machine Learning + Streamlit app that predicts estimated medical insurance costs based on user inputs (age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region). The project demonstrates data exploration, model training, and deploying a saved model (`Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.sav`) behind a lightweight Streamlit UI.

_This repository contains the dataset, training notebook, the trained model, and a Streamlit app for quick local demo._ :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Features
- Input personal details (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region) via an interactive web UI.
- Uses a trained regression model to predict expected insurance charges.
- Includes the original notebook for training (`main.ipynb`) and the saved model file (`Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.sav`).
- Quick to run locally with Streamlit.

## Quickstart / Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yajatdeshpande1513/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.git
cd Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
